			<h1>Who am I?</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Aidan Barton. 
				I am a senior at Virginia Tech, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Math and Cyber security.  
				Currently, I am interning at Rackspace on the Email Anti-Abuse team. 
				I am also an undergraduate researcher at the Hume Center for National Security and Technology.  
				When I am not on my computer I enjoy most outdoors activities such as hiking, mountain biking and rock climbing. 
				In other words, if there is a mountain involved, I am on it!

                        I am currently an intern at Rackspace (Summer 2017). I am working under Mat Grove on the Email Anti-Abuse team. 
                        This team is responsible for detecting and stoping bad guys from abusing the Rackspace email system (spaming, phishing, etc). 
                        I am currently building a new postmaster site for the team. 
                        This site will be used by other postmasters to get information like IP reputation, 
                        connecting IPs, why they can't send or recive email from rackspace, and other information postmasters might need from Rackspace.

                        We were trying to predict user behavior by looking only at packet inter-arrival time. 
                        Because we only look at the packet inter-arrival time, there is no reason to decreypt the packets. 
                        This makes it one step easier and people get less angry when you don't decrypt their information. 
                        We only looked at one user activity at a time (web browsing and streaming audio or video). 
                        We found a clear distinction between audio and video streaming; however, web browsing looked like a combo of both.
