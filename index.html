                  My name is Aidan Barton. I am a senior at Virginia Tech, majoring in Computer
                  Science with a minor in Math. Currently, I am working at Rackspace on the Email
                  Anti-Abuse team. When I am not on my computer I enjoy most outdoors activities
                  such as hiking, mountain biking and rock climbing. In other words, if there is a
                  mountain involved, I am on it!

                    During the summer of 2017 I was an intern at Rackspace. As an intern I was put
                    on a team with other interns and we were given free reign to build
                    Rackspace a new
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://postmaster.apps.rackspace.com/home">Postmaster</a>
                    site. I also worked on the Anti-abuse team, I created Ansible playbooks to
                    provision thier servers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the intership was finished they asked me to stick
                    around for a Co-op during the Fall 2017 semester, which I accepted. I am now
                    working on the anti-abuse team full time during the co-op. The team is
                    responsible for detecting and stopping bad
                    guys from abusing the Rackspace email system (spamming, phishing, etc).

                    The research involved trying to predict user behavior by looking at packet
                    inter-arrival time. Since we only looked at packet inter-arrival time there is
                    no reason to decrypt the packets. Avoiding decrypting packets means people get
                    less frustrated with regards to privacy. We found a clear distinction between
                    packet inter-arrival time of audio and video streaming; however, more research is needed to predict other activities.
